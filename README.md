Clock App - v1 by @Stravinci


The idea is to create a clock app similar to the one on a mobile phone. The "app" has 4 different features: 
1) Countdown/Timer: A simple timer that counts down from a user's input.
2) Stopwatch: Instead of counting down, it starts counting up. Maybe implement a pause/lap feature later.
3) World Clock: Displays the time in different timezones (For now, predefined ones).
4) Alarm: Set an alarm for a local time to give a notification. Maybe focuses on that window when it "rings".

Initially this implementation is done through the terminal. After this is successfully built, a tkinter version with visual information would be a great follow-up exercise.

Python practice
- Using the time module
Making the countdown, set alarms and notifications.
